# xkas (2011)
My version of xkas from 2011.

**This program is fully functional, but no longer used by the community.**

## About
xkas was originally a Super Nintendo assembler written by byuu. There were some bugs in the program and features it did not support that I really wanted it to. In byuu's own words "I wrote xkas in like one night..." and the organization reflected that. This version cleaned up a lot of his code and added some new features, like ExLoROM support, a DLL, and interop with C#, giving it a GUI app.

While xkas is no longer used by the community, I'm keeping the program here for archive purposes.
